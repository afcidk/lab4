A.
	function "double average(double *n1, double &n2)"
	--> _Z7averagePdRd
	(for "PdRd", P is pointer, d is double, R is reference)
	
	
	function "int average(int n1, float n2)"
	--> _Z7averageif
	(for "if", i is int, f is float)

	function "main()"
	--> main

B.

	output:
		1 8
		4 8
		4 8
		8 8

	"The sizeof() function will return the bytes of the type"

	since we know that: 

	pointer(regardless of the type) cost 8bytes
	char cost 1byte
	int cost 4byte
	float cost 4byte
	double cost 8byte
